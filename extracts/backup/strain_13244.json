Thanks to these effects and its high 15-18% average THC level, Zwarte Jan is often chosen to treat those suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, depression, chronic stress or anxiety and mood swings. This bud has a classic sweet and sour lemony pepper flavor with a touch of pine upon exhale. The aroma is very similar, with a lemony pine overtone that's accented by harsh black pepper and spices. Zwarte Jan buds have dense grape-shaped dusty green nugs with lots of orange hairs, dark leaves and a coating of frosty golden amber crystal trichomes.", "effects": ["Creative", "Euphoria", "Giggly", "Happy", "Relaxing", "Uplifting"], "aromas": ["Citrus", "Earthy", "Herbal", "Sour", "Spicy"], "flavors": ["Citrus", "Herbal", "Sour", "Spicy", "Sweet"], "relieves": ["Citrus", "Herbal", "Sour", "Spicy", "Sweet"], "type": "Indica Dominant Hybrid", "children": [], "parents": [], "aliases": [], "terpenes": []}}
